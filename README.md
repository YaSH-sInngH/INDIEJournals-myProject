### API Used

**News API** - News APIs typically provide access to a wide range of news articles from various sources, including newspapers, magazines, websites, and more.

You can often search for news articles based on keywords, topics, sources, dates, and other parameters. This allows you to filter and retrieve articles that are relevant to your needs.

You can generate your own API key from **NEWS API**.

  npm install
```

To Start the server

The port might looks way heavy but it's okay.
